            Originator's net commission in calculating any unearned commission not yet paid to Loan Originator. It is
            understood that Loan Originator is not entitled to commission simply for procuring a loan. Loan Originator's
            commissions on Commissionable Loans will be calculated by multiplying a pre-determined percentage rate (the
            "Commission Rate") against the principal amount of the Commissionable Loan, subject to Client Direct
            Mortgage's right to establish a maximum or minimum commission amount. Additional terms regarding Loan

            properly recorded and funds have been received by Client Direct Mortgage whether as a creditor or as a
            broker). If applicable, there shall be deducted from Loan Originator's commissions all sums required by
            state and federal law including but not limited to federal and state income taxes, social security, medical
            and state disability insurance. W-2 employees shall have taxes and statutory withholdings deducted. 1099

            sixteen (16) and thirty (30) days following the date of his/her termination. Loan Originator acknowledges
            and agrees that he/she shall not have earned, nor be due, any commission or compensation, in connection with
            a Commissionable Loan which funds and closes thirty-one (31) or more days after termination of Loan

            services unless and until said loan funds and closes, and Client Direct Mortgage actually receives a fee.
            Client Direct Mortgage shall have no obligation to pay Loan Originator any compensation in connection with
            any residential mortgage loan which does not fund and close or on which Client Direct Mortgage does not
            actually receive a fee.

            <span class="bold">15.02</span> Client Direct Mortgage does not impose maximum compensation per file;
            however, the company will assume a maximum early payoff (EPO) exposure of $20,000 per loan. If the Loan
            Originator's commission on a single file exceeds $20,000, the excess amount above this threshold will be
            held in reserve and disbursed after the expiration of the applicable EPO period, provided the loan is not
            paid off early and no EPO penalty is incurred. The EPO period shall be determined by the applicable investor

            LOAN FRAUD - ZERO TOLERANCE
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            Client Direct Mortgage is responsible for the actions of those of its loan originators who are engaged in
            the business of originating residential mortgage loans on behalf of its borrowers. Notwithstanding this
            responsibility, however, Loan Originator acknowledges and agrees that he/she bears responsibility for the
            content and quality of each loan application taken and each loan originated by Loan Originator.

        <div class="center bold caps">
            THE SUBMISSION OF A LOAN APPLICATION CONTAINING FALSE INFORMATION IS A CRIME!!!
        </div>

        <div class="bold underline keep-with-next">Some Types of Loan Fraud</div>

        <ol>
            <li>Submission of inaccurate information, including false statements on loan application(s) and/or
                falsification of documents purporting to substantiate credit, engagement, deposit and asset information,
                personal information including identity, ownership/non-ownership of real property, etc.</li>

            <li>Forgery of partially or predominantly accurate information.</li>

            <li>Incorrect statements regarding current occupancy or intent to maintain minimum continuing occupancy as
                stated in the security instrument.</li>

            <li>Lack of due diligence by Client Direct Mortgage/Loan Originator/interviewer/processor, including failure
                to obtain all information required by the application and/or failure to request information as
                necessitated by borrower's response to other questions.</li>

            <li>Unquestioned acceptance of information or documentation, which is known, should be known, or should be
                suspected to be inaccurate. For example:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Simultaneous or consecutive processing of multiple owner-occupied loans from one applicant
                        supplying different information on each application.</li>

                    <li>Allowing an applicant or interested third party to assist with the processing of the loan.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Non-disclosure of relevant information.</li>

            <li>Excessive fees or charges not disclosed.</li>
        </ol>


        <div class="bold underline keep-with-next">Consequences</div>

        <div class="section">
            The effects of loan fraud are costly to all parties involved. Fraudulent loans cannot be sold in the
            secondary market and, if sold, may require that Client Direct Mortgage purchase those loans. Fraudulent
            loans damage the reputation of Client Direct Mortgage with lenders, investors and mortgage insurance
            providers, and expose Client Direct Mortgage to considerable risk of liability.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            The price paid by those who participate in loan fraud is even more costly. The following is a list of a few
            of the potential consequences that may by incurred.

        will earn a commission on each mortgage loan originated by Loan Originator that is originated: (i)
        in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) for which Client Direct Mortgage
        has received all required loan documentation, as determined in its sole discretion from time to
        time; (iii) in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and

        contain, any fraud, misrepresentation or other material defect that might reasonably subject Client
        Direct Mortgage to a risk of loss (each a "Commissionable Loan"); (vi) and has been sold on the
        secondary market with the period for any early payment default or early payoff period having
        expired. Notwithstanding, Client Direct Mortgage may advance the commission on loans once they have
        been closed. In the event such commission is advanced, but is later deemed un-earnable as a result
        of any early payment default or payoff, the amounts advanced will be subtracted from Originator's net
        commission in calculating any unearned commission not yet paid to Loan Originator. It is understood
        that Loan Originator is not entitled to commission simply for procuring a loan. Loan Originator's
        commissions on Commissionable Loans will be calculated by multiplying a pre-determined percentage
        rate (the "Commission Rate") against the principal amount of the Commissionable Loan, subject to
        Client Direct Mortgage's right to establish a maximum or minimum commission amount. Additional terms
        regarding Loan Originator's compensation are set forth at <b>Exhibit A </b>hereto. Loan Originator's
        intentional violation of Client <span class="s2">Direct Mortgage's compensation policies shall be

        loan on which he/she performed loan origination services unless and until said loan funds and
        closes, and Client Direct Mortgage actually receives a fee. Client Direct Mortgage shall have no
        obligation to pay Loan Originator any compensation in connection with any residential mortgage loan
        which does not fund and close or on which Client Direct Mortgage does not actually receive a fee.</p>
    
    <p class="padding-top-13 list-data">15.02 Client Direct
        Mortgage does not impose maximum compensation per file; however, the company will assume a maximum
        early payoff (EPO) exposure of $20,000 per loan. If the Loan Originator's commission on a single
        file exceeds $20,000, the excess amount above this threshold will be held in reserve and disbursed
        after the expiration of the applicable EPO period, provided the loan is not paid off early and no
        EPO penalty is incurred. The EPO period shall be determined by the applicable investor guidelines
        for the specific loan and may vary accordingly.</p>

        payments.</p>

    <p class="list-data">15.04 Loan Originator acknowledges and

        escrow fees, document fees, property inspections, or for any other third-party fee, nor shall any
        such fee be included in the calculation of the compensation set forth below. Applicable expenses can
        be payroll cost, unpaid invoices, tolerance cures or any other expense that impacts revenue on a
        closed and funded loan. The platform fee is $149 per month. A 9.75% fee will be applied to gross commission to cover administrative costs.</p>

    <h1 class="padding-top-13" style="text-align: center;">Some Types of Loan Fraud</h1>
    
    <p class="padding-top-13 list-item-indent">1. Submission of
        inaccurate information, including false statements on loan application(s) and/or falsification of
        documents purporting to substantiate credit, engagement, deposit and asset information, personal
        information including identity, ownership/non-ownership of real property, etc.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>
    
    <p class="list-item-indent-alt">2. Forgery of partially or predominantly
        accurate information.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>
    
    <p class="list-item-indent">3. Incorrect statements regarding current

    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>
    
    <p class="list-item-indent" style="justify-content: left !important;">4. Lack of due diligence by Client Direct
        Mortgage/Loan Originator/interviewer/processor, including failure to obtain all information required by

        questions.</p>

    <p class="list-item-indent">5. Unquestioned acceptance of information

        <p class="text-indent-18 paragraph-justify">The effects of loan fraud are costly to all
            parties involved. Fraudulent loans cannot be sold in the secondary market and, if sold, may require that Client
            Direct Mortgage purchase those loans. Fraudulent loans damage the reputation of Client Direct Mortgage with
            lenders, investors and mortgage insurance providers, and expose Client Direct Mortgage to considerable risk of
            liability.</p>
        <p class="padding-top-13 text-indent-18 paragraph-justify">The price paid by those who
            participate in loan fraud is even more costly. The following is a list of a few of the potential consequences

        secondary market with the period for any early payment default or early payoff period having
        expired. Notwithstanding, Searchlight Home Loans may advance the commission on loans once they have
        been closed. In the event such commission is advanced, but is later deemed un-earnable as a result
        of any early payment default or payoff, the amounts advanced will be subtracted from Originator's net
        commission in calculating any unearned commission not yet paid to Loan Originator. It is understood
        that Loan Originator is not entitled to commission simply for procuring a loan. Loan Originator's
        commissions on Commissionable Loans will be calculated by multiplying a pre-determined percentage
        rate (the "Commission Rate") against the principal amount of the Commissionable Loan, subject to
        Searchlight Home Loans's right to establish a maximum or minimum commission amount. Additional terms
        regarding Loan Originator's compensation are set forth at <b>Exhibit A </b>hereto. Loan Originator's
        intentional violation of Client <span class="s2">Direct Mortgage's compensation policies shall be
            cause for discipline, up to and including immediate termination of Loan Originator's

    </div>
    <p class="text-indent-18 paragraph-justify">Searchlight Home Loans is responsible for the
        actions of those of its loan originators who are engaged in the business of originating residential mortgage
        loans on behalf of its borrowers. Notwithstanding this responsibility, however, Loan Originator acknowledges and

    <h1 class="header-center">THE SUBMISSION OF A LOAN APPLICATION CONTAINING
        FALSE INFORMATION IS A CRIME!!!</h1>
    <h1 class="padding-top-13" style="text-align: center;">Some Types of Loan Fraud</h1>

    <p class="padding-top-13 list-item-indent">1. Submission of
        inaccurate information, including false statements on loan application(s) and/or falsification of
        documents purporting to substantiate credit, engagement, deposit and asset information, personal
        information including identity, ownership/non-ownership of real property, etc.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent-alt">2. Forgery of partially or predominantly
        accurate information.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent">3. Incorrect statements regarding current
        occupancy or intent to maintain minimum continuing occupancy as stated in the security instrument.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent" style="justify-content: left !important;">4. Lack of due diligence by Client Direct
        Mortgage/Loan Originator/interviewer/processor, including failure to obtain all information required by
        the application and/or failure to request information as necessitated by borrower's response to other
        questions.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent">5. Unquestioned acceptance of information
        or documentation, which is known, should be known, or should be suspected to be inaccurate. For example:</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent-51">a. Simultaneous or consecutive
        processing of multiple owner-occupied loans from one applicant supplying different information
        on each application.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent-51">b. Allowing an applicant or
        interested third party to assist with the processing of the loan.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent-alt">6. Non-disclosure of relevant information.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>
    <p class="text-indent-18 paragraph-justify">The effects of loan fraud are costly to all
        parties involved. Fraudulent loans cannot be sold in the secondary market and, if sold, may require that Client
        Direct Mortgage purchase those loans. Fraudulent loans damage the reputation of Searchlight Home Loans with
        lenders, investors and mortgage insurance providers, and expose Searchlight Home Loans to considerable risk of
        liability.</p>
    <p class="padding-top-13 text-indent-18 paragraph-justify">The price paid by those who
        participate in loan fraud is even more costly. The following is a list of a few of the potential consequences
        that may by incurred.</p>
    <p class="s7 padding-top-13 paragraph-left-alt">Potential Consequences
        to Loan Originator and/or Searchlight Home Loans</p>

    <p class="padding-top-13 list-item-indent-alt">1. Criminal prosecution.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-left"><br /></p>

    <p class="list-item-indent-alt">2. Loss of professional license.</p>

    <p class="list-item-indent">3. Loss of lender access and/or investor
        relationships due to exchange of information between lenders and mortgage insurance companies including
        submission of information to investors (e.g., FHLMC and FHMA).</p>

    <p class="list-item-indent-alt">4. Civil action by applicant/borrower or

        Mortgage/Deed of Trust in effect at any given time, as well as the Mortgage/Deeds of Trust of other
        institutional investors, provide substantially as follows: "Borrower shall also be in default if
        borrower, during the loan application process, gave materially false or inaccurate information or
        statements to lender or failed to provide lender with any material information in connection with the
        loan evidenced by the note, including, but not limited to, representations concerning borrower's
        occupancy of the property as a principle residence."</p>

        required to pay off the loan in full prior to the sale date of the real property security.</h1>

            THE SUBMISSION OF A LOAN APPLICATION CONTAINING FALSE INFORMATION IS A CRIME!!!
        </div>

        <div class="bold underline keep-with-next">Some Types of Loan Fraud</div>

        <ol>
            <li>Submission of inaccurate information, including false statements on loan application(s) and/or
                falsification of documents purporting to substantiate credit, engagement, deposit and asset information,
                personal information including identity, ownership/non-ownership of real property, etc.</li>

            <li>Forgery of partially or predominantly accurate information.</li>

            <li>Incorrect statements regarding current occupancy or intent to maintain minimum continuing occupancy as
                stated in the security instrument.</li>

            <li>Lack of due diligence by Searchlight Home Loans/Loan Originator/interviewer/processor, including failure
                to obtain all information required by the application and/or failure to request information as
                necessitated by borrower's response to other questions.</li>

            <li>Unquestioned acceptance of information or documentation, which is known, should be known, or should be
                suspected to be inaccurate. For example:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Simultaneous or consecutive processing of multiple owner-occupied loans from one applicant

                    <li>Allowing an applicant or interested third party to assist with the processing of the loan.</li>

        <div class="bold underline keep-with-next">Consequences</div>

        <div class="section">
            The effects of loan fraud are costly to all parties involved. Fraudulent loans cannot be sold in the
            secondary market and, if sold, may require that Searchlight Home Loans purchase those loans. Fraudulent
            loans damage the reputation of Searchlight Home Loans with lenders, investors and mortgage insurance
            providers, and expose Searchlight Home Loans to considerable risk of liability.

        <div class="section">
            The price paid by those who participate in loan fraud is even more costly. The following is a list of a few
